## Background

#### Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

#### The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

#### The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [dataset](https://github.com/giovannahayes/D3-challenge/tree/main/D3_data_journalism/StarterCode/assets/data). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Required and Bonus Task

#### Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty

#### Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 

#### Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for three risk factors for each axis. 
* Include state abbreviations in the circles.
* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
* Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. Use the d3-tip.js plugin
